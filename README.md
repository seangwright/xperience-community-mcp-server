## Description

An [MCP Server](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers) built with the [.NET MCP Server SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk) tailored for Xperience by Kentico projects and installed as a NuGet package.

Why use this library? By exposing a discrete set of documented tools to [an AI agent](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2025/02/24/introducing-copilot-agent-mode) in an Xperience by Kentico project, that agent has more well structured context and capabilities. This means it can be a better copilot to developers building features for marketers using Xperience by Kentico.

For a more detailed explanation of this project, read the blog post _[Turn your Xperience by Kentico application into an MCP Server](https://community.kentico.com/blog/turn-your-xperience-by-kentico-application-into-an-mcp-server)_.

## Requirements

### Library Version Matrix

| Xperience Version | Library Version |
| ----------------- | --------------- |
| >= 30.4.1         | 1.0.0           |

## Package Installation

Add the package to your application using the .NET CLI

```powershell
dotnet add package XperienceCommunity.MCPServer
```

## Quick Start

1. Once the package is installed, update your Xperience by Kentico application `Program.cs`

   ```csharp
   // Program.cs

   // ...

   // Adds the MCP dependencies
   if (builder.Environment.IsDevelopment())
   {
       builder.Services.AddXperienceMCPServer();
   }

   // ...

   // Adds the MCP endpoint
   if (builder.Environment.IsDevelopment())
   {
       app.UseXperienceMCPServer();
   }

   app.Kentico().MapRoutes();

   // ...
   ```

1. Start your Xperience by Kentico application.

1. Set up your [MCP Server configuration VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers#_enable-mcp-support-in-vs-code)

   ```json
   {
     "servers": {
       "xperience-mcp-server": {
         "type": "http",
         "url": "http://localhost:<your-port-here>/xperience-mcp"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   You can use the `.vscode/mcp.json` configuration as an example. The scheme, domain, and port come from the `examples/DancingGoat/Properties/launchSettings.json` file since the DancingGoat Xperience by Kentico application also runs the MCP Server. The default MCP Server path prefix is `/xperience-mcp`.

   You can use the VS Code command palette to [manage and start your MCP Server](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers#_managing-tools) or you can click the "Start" action above your server configuration in `mcp.json`.

   **Note**: VS Code's MCP client [does not yet support self-signed certificates](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/248170), so you will need to add an http:// binding in your ASP.NET Core `launchSettings.json` file if you have been using https:// and [dev-certs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-dev-certs) for your Xperience application. This binding can be any unused localhost port. Ex: `http://localhost:34543`. After you add the binding, update your `mcp.json` to use the `http://` URL.

1. Use the tools exposed by the Xperience Community MCP ServerÂ [in agent mode in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers#_use-mcp-tools-in-agent-mode) with a prompt in GitHub Copilot chat.
